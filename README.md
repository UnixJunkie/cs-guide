Some guidelines for computational scientists.

Introduction
------------

Guidelines
----------

- Learn a scripting language.
E.g. Python, Ruby, Perl. As a fallback, at least learn some modern
shell (e.g. zsh, Bash).

- Learn a programmable statistics package.

- Save everything in text files.

- use config files. 

- Delete data you don't need.

- Learn the art of renaming data files and directories. 

- off-the-shelf third party software,
  always generate complete config files in a script. 

- Learn to use a command-line plotting program.
  E.g. gnuplot, R, mathplotlib

- Get a real programming editor.

- Automate everything

- Beware of the NIH (Not Invented Here) syndrome.
  FBR: this is maybe better describbed as doing orthogonal
       modifications to OTS software

Meta guidelines
---------------

Work smart (related to automate everything).
